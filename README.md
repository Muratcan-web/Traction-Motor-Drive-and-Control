# Traction-Motor-Drive-and-Control
In this project, I worked on the Control and Power Boards of a Traction Motor Drive system. The drive system is capable of controlling upto 36kW AC Induction Motors. 

You can find the required circuits and layout of the system in this repository. The detailed explanations of the firmware can be found in "TMD Final Report.pdf" document.
